    Definition

        Simple file analyzation program for detecting malware using MD5
        hashes.

    Details

        This project is not really to be seen as a serious tool. It only shows
        how to make simple comparisons using the fingerprint of a file using
        SHA256 hashes.

        Such comparisons are used by various programs, including virus and
        malware scanners (of course, these use further methods to analyze
        files).

        Anyway, this project is an example of a basic malware scanner. It has
        a simple definition list which contains fingerprints of malicious
        files.

        By default, the definitions contain just fingerprints of the EICAR
        test signature in various formats as well as one of the included test
        file, but the list can be easily enhanced (see the definition file
        'definitions.md5' inside the 'definitions' sub-directory for details).

    Implementation

        Some things were not considered during the implementation or were not
        relevant for this sample project. As already mentioned above, it is
        not really to be seen as a serious tool and also is not intended to
        become one.

        For example, the way in which the virus definitions are loaded is very
        inefficient and can consume a large amount of memory, depending on the
        size of the definition files containing the signatures as they are
        completely loaded into a variable.

        Futhermore, the whole scanning method needs a revision or even to be
        rewritten due to inefficiency and the fact that it is incomplete (only
        works with MD5 checksums).

        These are just two of many things that could or should be done better.

    Requirements

        In order to run fap4malware, the Python 3.x framework must be
        installed on the system.

        There is no official version for Python 2.x, but if you need that for
        whatever reason, you can try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to
        version 2.x using the '3to2' tool:

            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2

        However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.

        The project should run on the usual platforms, but has only been
        tested on Linux so far.

    Usage

        For example, to scan all files inside the directory '/tmp/foobar' as
        well as all of its sub-directories:

            import fap4malware
            f = fap4malware.Fap4Malware()
            f.scan(directory="/tmp/foobar", recursive=True, scan_all=True)
            f.scan("/tmp/foobar", True, True)   # the short form

    Useless facts

        Yes, I am aware that the name of the project is ambiguous, but it has
        nothing to do with the corresponding verb. It is an abbreviation for
        "file analyzation program".
