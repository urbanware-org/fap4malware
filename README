    Definition

        Simple file analyzation program for detecting malware using SHA256
        hashes.

    Details

        This project is not really to be seen as a serious tool. It only shows
        how to make simple comparisons using the fingerprint of a file using
        SHA256 hashes.

        Such comparisons are used by various programs, including virus and
        malware scanners (of course, these use further methods to analyze
        files).

        Anyway, this project is an example of a basic malware scanner. It has
        a simple definition list which contains fingerprints of malicious
        files.

        By default, the definitions contain just fingerprints of the EICAR
        test signature in various formats as well as one of the included test
        file, but the list can be easily enhanced (see the definition file
        'definitions.md5' inside the 'definitions' sub-directory for details).

    Requirements

        In order to run fap4malware, the Python 3.x framework must be
        installed on the system.

        There is no official version for Python 2.x, but if you need that for
        whatever reason, you can try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to
        version 2.x using the '3to2' tool:

            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/3to2

        However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.

        The project should run on the usual platforms, but has only been
        tested on Linux so far.

    Usage

        For example, to scan all files inside the directory '/tmp/foobar' as
        well as all of its sub-directories:

            import fap4malware
            f = fap4malware.Fap4Malware()
            f.scan(directory="/tmp/foobar", recursive=True, scan_all=True)
            f.scan("/tmp/foobar", True, True)   # the short form

        you can find the contact information inside the 'CONTACT' file.

    Useless facts

        Yes, I am aware that the name of the project is ambiguous, but it has
        nothing to do with the corresponding verb. It is an abbreviation for
        "file analyzation program".
